### How we store personal information

We value your trust in providing us your personal information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. We will take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, loss and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Your personal information will always be stored in a secure online environment. All service providers we contract with are required to have a Privacy Policy. However, please note that there are risks associated with providing information to us through electronic means, example, via the internet or email and the information may be insecure in transit, particularly where no encryption is used such as through email.
